It is formatted in tables with rows and columns, where each piece of information has a specific field and is stored in a predefined format. This kind of data is typically numerical or categorical and easy to process using traditional data tools.\n","\n","**Examples of Structured Data**:\n","- **Customer Information**: Tables containing customer IDs, names, emails, phone numbers, etc.\n","- **Financial Records**: Transaction records with columns for transaction ID, date, amount, and account number.\n","- **Sensor Data**: Data from IoT devices like temperature, humidity, and pressure readings recorded in a table format.\n","\n","# **> Unstructured Data**  \n","Unstructured data lacks a predefined format or organization, making it more challenging to analyze and manage. It can include text-heavy information, images, videos, and other types of data that don’t fit neatly into tables. Unstructured data often requires advanced techniques like natural language processing (NLP) or computer vision to extract useful insights.\n","\n","**Examples of Unstructured Data**:\n","- **Text Documents**: Emails, PDFs, and social media posts.\n","- **Images and Videos**: Photographs, CCTV footage, and YouTube videos.\n","- **Audio**: Customer service call recordings, voice messages, or podcast audio files.\n","\n","#### **Comparison Summary**  \n","- **Structured data**: Organized in tables, easily searchable, and manageable in databases (SQL).\n","- **Unstructured data**: No fixed format, harder to process, often requires specialized tools (NLP, image recognition).\n","\n","Would you like information on how these types of data are processed?"],"metadata":{"id":"8Lh5ocytvzVP"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["# **Three types of Images**\n","1. **Colored Images**  \n","   * Colored images display a full range of colors and are typically represented using RGB (Red, Green, Blue).\n","   * **Layers :** 3 (Red, Green, Blue).\n","   * **Pixel range :** $0 - 255$\n","\n","   - **Examples**: Photographs, digital artwork, any visual needing full color\n","   - **Use Cases**: Websites, print media, advertisements, any application where color detail is essential.\n","\n","2. **Grayscale Images**\n","   * Grayscale images consist of shades of gray, ranging from black to white.
