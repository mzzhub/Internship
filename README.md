# Data Science and Machine Learning Internship Projects

This repository contains a collection of projects and assignments completed during my internship at [Softroniics](https://softroniics.com). The work encompasses various aspects of data science, machine learning, deep learning, and object detection using images, videos, and live feeds.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following directories:

```
.
├── Data/               # Datasets in CSV and other formats
├── Images/             # Images used for object detection and visualization
├── Notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and model development
├── Videos/             # Video files for object detection tasks
├── Live_Feed/          # Scripts for real-time object detection using live camera feeds
├── Labeling/           # Tools and files for data labeling
└── README.md           # Repository documentation
```

## Contents

### Data (`Data/`)

This directory contains datasets in CSV format used for various data analysis and machine learning tasks.

### Images (`Images/`)

Contains images utilized in object detection models and for visualization purposes.

### Notebooks (`Notebooks/`)

Includes Jupyter notebooks covering:

- **Data Preprocessing**: Techniques for cleaning and preparing data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Methods for analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implementation of algorithms for predictive modeling.
- **Deep Learning Architectures**: Development of neural network models.
- **Object Detection**: Approaches for detecting objects in various media.

### Videos (`Videos/`)

Contains video files used in object detection and tracking projects.

### Live Feed (`Live_Feed/`)

Scripts and code for performing object detection on live camera feeds.

### Labeling (`Labeling/`)

Tools and datasets for labeling images and videos to create training data for supervised learning models.

## Getting Started

To explore the projects:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mzzhub/Internship.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the desired directory** to access datasets, notebooks, or scripts.
3. **Install necessary dependencies** as specified in each notebook or script.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required Python packages (e.g., NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, TensorFlow, OpenCV)

You can install the necessary packages using `pip` and the `requirements.txt` file provided in the repository:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
