## Repository Contents

### 1. Jupyter Notebooks (`.ipynb` files)
The Jupyter notebooks contain Python code and explanations for various Data Science topics covered during the training. Each notebook is structured to facilitate understanding and includes:
- Data preprocessing techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Machine Learning models
- Visualization examples

### 2. Images
A collection of images generated during training, including visualizations like:
- Histograms
- Scatter plots
- Heatmaps
- Model performance graphs

### 3. CSV Files
Datasets used in the projects, including:
- Input data for analysis
- Processed data for machine learning models
- Outputs from data transformations
