John went to the park.
The sun was shining.
Sara read a book.
The birds were singing.
John saw a dog.
The dog barked loudly.
Sara smiled at the dog.
John waved to Sara.
The clouds were fluffy.
Sara liked the weather.
John picked a flower.
The flower was yellow.
Sara thanked John.
The wind was gentle.
John sat on the bench.
Sara joined him.
They talked about the day.
John loved the park.
Sara agreed with him.
They both laughed.
