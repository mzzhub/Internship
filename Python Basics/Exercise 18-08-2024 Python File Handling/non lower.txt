THE SKY WAS DARK AND STORMY.
Lightning flashed across the horizon.
THE WIND HOWLED THROUGH THE TREES.
Everyone in the village stayed indoors.
NOBODY DARED TO VENTURE OUTSIDE.
Thunder rumbled in the distance.
RAIN BEGAN TO POUR DOWN HEAVILY.
It was a night to remember.
THE STREETS WERE DESERTED AND QUIET.
Only the sound of rain filled the air.
FINALLY, THE STORM BEGAN TO SUBSIDE.
Peace returned to the land once more.
